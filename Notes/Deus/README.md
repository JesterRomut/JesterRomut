# Heaven's Hell Sent Gifts

我被大画家值班，就像被狗吃掉的星虫...

大病一场

## Astrum Deus

空心炸鳞可怜虫。疯疯癫癫的，却还保留着一丝神性。

本来是吃掉死星来清理星辉瘟疫的星神一条，被神吞（方法未知）偷袭吃掉，下半身和内部都被掏空了。

现在和瘟疫共存...长回了下半身，但是内部被一层瘟疫组织接管，长不回来了。脊柱在空洞的胸腔里肿胀成类似心脏的形状，借此看起来稍微充实点。

~~本来清理瘟疫的神在狗的压力下终究还是跟最讨厌的瘟疫签订了契约~~
<br>

被瘟疫感染到脑子，每次想恢复都会同时想散播瘟疫，感染全世界。

很渴望一颗心，但是往体内塞进的东西最终都变成了瘟疫的，吃进去的东西也一样。

✝天罚☦「神火」

An hollow worm with pinecone scales caused by Astral Infection. Looks ill, but still retains a hint of divinity.

It used to be the Star God, consuming these stars before the Astral Infection manifests in them, and it has been revered for its sacred duty since time immemorial.

Thus, it got killed by the Devourer of Gods, lower half and all innards was eaten.

Now, it's co-existing with the disease, have lower body grown back, but the innards got replaced by the infection. Its spine bloats like a heart, in the chest cavity opened by a incurable wound, makes it look a little more substantial.

~~The god who originally cleaned up the infection finally signed a contract with the most annoying infection under the pressure of DoG.~~

Wished a heart, but everything goes inside it will be consumed by the infection, including things it ate.

Still, it will put everything which looked like a heart into its chest cavity.
