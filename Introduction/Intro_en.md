#### About‚ú∞ My ‚ú∞noble‚ú∞ Names


About‚ú∞ my name„ÄåJester‚ú∞Romut„Äç. The ‚ú∞noble‚ú∞ i am a absolutely PURE‚ú∞\~ joker who speak with cute‚ú∞stars! Want to be more‚ú∞cute ‚ô™<br>
My‚ú∞ symbolic name‚ú∞„Äå‚ôó„Äç may be very archaic‚ú∞~

#### Jester‚ú∞ in Pony‚ú∞Town

The ‚ú∞noble‚ú∞ I play Pony‚ú∞Town‚ô™ When you see an„Äå‚ú∞Away‚ú∞„Äçstatus‚ú∞\~ that means noble‚ú∞I am awesome‚ú∞ afking, p.‚ú∞ use whisper / mail / discussion instead of directly say‚ú∞\~<br>
Do not cover the noble‚ú∞me (or take too close) regardless I am awesome‚ú∞ afking or not, Jester‚ú∞ always forget turning„Äå‚ú∞Away‚ú∞„Äçoff! KEEP‚ú∞\~ SOCIAL‚ú∞DISTANCE! ~~because you may die due noble‚ú∞I am too ‚ú∞cute‚ú∞~~<br>

To (except Terrarians) ponies who want to come‚ú∞play in places near noble‚ú∞me but do not want to talk to me: I do not care about you, unless you want to cover noble‚ú∞me or sit in the same place as noble‚ú∞me(considered covering ‚Üêbad), but TrC ponies may attack you (sorry!), Keep distance with them!


ABSOLUTELY! NO! COPYING! (unless you have noble‚ú∞authorized from noble‚ú∞me). G00‚ú∞Directly tell me if you found one! Noble‚ú∞I will give them an awe‚ú∞awesome‚ú∞Punishment\~


Noble‚ú∞I never hide other ponies\~ Hiding does not fit my philosophy and causes misunderstandings‚ú∞ Noble‚ú∞I really dislike misunderstandings‚ú∞

#### Jester's‚ú∞ Hate‚ô™ Der Hass

Jester do not like‚ô™ >_<:


*You can do things which i don't like in private place unless you deliberately let me see, as no one will care things outside their range*


Do not say that i am discriminating something, if you are right that despise of any group is considered discriminationüßê<br>
Before you attack me, you should think about there are lots of difference between the chinese internet and english internet. THINK DEEPLY.


(Bottomline Level: If you have any of these, you would better go to confess <sub>OR GO DIRECTLY TO HELL.</sub> instead of reading this)


- Prostitute / Surrogacy
- Addict (and people who support addicts)
- Gamble addict
- China insulting & Baizuo that support blacks but do not support chinese
- Man killer
- My Hero Academia ‚ÜêChina insulting & anti-human, their fans are all racist after that event


(Discomfort Level: If you have any of these, I may not become your friend)


- Gay(BL) & Lesbian(GL) due to religion reasons. If you do attack me due to i don't support gays, you are equivalent to pork lover who attack halal restaurants as it does not offer pork. Pork lovers can order beef / mutton in halal restaurant like other people, but NOT pork. Respect other's belief!
- Mental illness(depression, bipolar, asperger & autism, DID, antisocial etc.) All of these are regarded as stacking buffs. 
- Buff stacking & LGBT stacking for getting other people's sympathy or just for cool. I will think all of your mental illnesses are fake as long as you are on the internet, you would better go back to your baizuo english internet (or clinic)
- Show affection in public regardless your gender. My parent taught me that„ÄåÁî∑Â•≥ÊéàÂèó‰∏ç‰∫≤„Äç(male & female should keep some distances)
- Xiao Zhan, mxtx, mdzs & tgcf ‚ÜêThese things are public discomforts in chinese internet. Fans of them are burning loving them, therefore other people hate them. sorry I am not a fans and I HATE them due to their fans especially love to show BL affection.<br>
If you already know these are public discomforts in china and still love them and DELIBERATELY go near me and let me see, sorry, I will attack you, do not say i did not warn you.
- Games of Project Moon (Lobotomy C & LoR etc.) ‚ÜêThere are lots of mental illnesses in PMoon players in chinese internet, and they do cyberbully (yes, i got cyberbullied from them). They are especially neurotic and masters of rumor spreading


(Attention level: If you have any of these, I may pay extra attention of you to prevent suddenly unexpected behaviors)


- Aotu world
- Honor of King & Genshin Impact & Arknights
- identity V
- Sky children of light

  4 above are public discomforts in china but less discomfort than mxtx (mxtx >> Aotu > IDV > H&G&A > Sky)

- country humans ‚Üêpolitically sensitive & have lots of crazy people
- Furry


Noble‚ú∞I have ‚ú∞reasons‚ú∞ for disliking things above! Do not evaluate if you do not know the reasons‚ú∞<br>
(If you throw a stone in a barn, the one that screams the loudest is always the one that gets hit)<br>
But there are always‚ú∞exceptions! because‚ú∞ Noble‚ú∞I have a flexible ethical line, therefore you can make friends even if you have one or two above(except bottomlines)‚ô™
